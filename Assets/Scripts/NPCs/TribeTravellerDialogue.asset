  dialogueLines:
  - oh hi! I'm Antonio, nice to meet you!
  - I think I saw you coming out of the caves, you're quite the adventurous type!
  - Maybe you'd like to listen to my story then
  - Believe it or not, just behind the mountain on the horizon, there's a fantastic
    red thing to eat
  - How do I know? I travel from place to place, that's kind of my hobby
  - It's always nice to meet new friends!
  - I took some of the red thing with me, not much left after all the travel, but
    I can share it with you!
  - '*om nom nom nom*'
  - yes indeed! It's very sweet and crunchy, definitely the best thing I've ever
    eaten
  - if you want to get some for yourself, the road is pretty simple.
  - ' just be cautious, there are many dangers along the way!'
  - I think I'll get some rest now
