  - EEEEEK! Don't hurt me!
  - ...wait
  - You're not one of *them*, are you?
  - then... how did you sneak past them?
  - I'm sorry for my initial reaction, but...
  - we didn't have contact with anyone outside for a very long time
  - I saw the world turn white twice since
  - I'm Jeff, by the way
  - Anyway... you probably wanna talk with the guy living in the tall building
  - He can give you some food and a place to rest
  - You will probably encounter King of Hedgehogs
  - Just remember fighting is not always the best option...
